# Big-O-Experiements

There are 3 files which match three experiements in Showbie.  I have inserted comment breaks which you can toggle on and off to gray-out some of the code so only one of them runs at a time.  Run each code block 3 times and calculate the average.

For all experiements **do not count** the very first time you run a file.  This run always takes longer as atom is loading parts of the JavaScript library into its cache.
